# Data Analysis

*By Roland Waddilove*

I'm learning Python and wrote this as a learning exercise. I wanted to practise analysing data, so I downloaded some data and analyse it in various ways.
There are probably modules that can do this faster, better, and easier. Hopefully, the code may help other learners.

### What data?

I am using data from the UK National Lottery. Go to https://www.national-lottery.co.uk/results/lotto/draw-history-uc and download the CSV file.
Save it somewhere, like the Downloads folder. The program asks where it is when it first runs.

UK Lotto is pick 6 from 59. The result includes a bonus number, so 6 numbers plus 1 extra. If your lottery uses different numbers, you will need to edit the code.

### Analysis

* The raw data
* Numbers ordered with the least common first
* Numbers ordered with the most common first
* Overdue numbers (not seen for a long time)
* Number of odd and even numbers
* Average numbers for each ball in the draw
